## Installation

### Installing the plugin

1. In Obsidian, open **Settings**
2. Go to **Community plugins**
3. Select **Browse**
4. Search for **Dashboards** by **Trey Wallis**
5. Select **Install**
6. Then select **Enable**

### Linking dashboard files

By default, Obsidian won't display `.dashboard` files in the menu that opens when you type double brackets `[[`. In order for Obsidian to do this, you must enable detection of all file extensions.

1. In Obsidian, open **Settings**
2. Select **File & Links**
3. Toggle **Detect all file extensions**

This will allow you to make links to a dashboard e.g. `[[my-dashboard.dashboard]]`

## Getting started

Start by creating a new dashboard. You can do this by clicking on the dashboard icon on the sidebar.
