DataLoom is an [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) plugin for desktop and mobile. It is a database tool similar to [Notion.so](https://notion.so) and [DB folder](https://github.com/RafaelGB/obsidian-db-folder). It allows you to weave together data from diverse sources, including Obsidian elements like folders or frontmatter, and display them in multiple views. This plugin is ideal for you if you seek a straightforward yet powerful tool to create and manage databases and enhance the organization and accessibility of your Obsidian vault.

## Network Usage

According to [Obsidian developer policies](https://docs.obsidian.md/Developer+policies), an Obsidian plugin must explain which network services are used and why.

DataLoom will make one `GET` request to `https://api.github.com/repos/trey-wallis/obsidian-dataloom/releases/latest` to pull the latest release for the What's New Modal. Besides this, DataLoom does not make any network requests. DataLoom does not include client-side telemetry.

## License

## Disclaimer

This plugin extends the functionality of Obsidian.md. Although tested during development, there may still be bugs in the software. I **strongly** recommend you to make frequent backup copies of your vault. I am not responsible for any data that is lost due to the usage of this plugin.
