### Linking dashboard files

2. Select **File & Links**
3. Toggle **Detect all file extensions**

## Network Usage

According to Obsidian developer policies, an Obsidian plugin must explain which network services are used and why.

Dashboards will make one `GET` request to `https://api.github.com/repos/trey-wallis/obsidian-dashboards/releases/latest` to pull the lastest release for the What's New Modal. Besides this, Dashboards does not making any network requests. Dashboards does not include client-side telemetry.
