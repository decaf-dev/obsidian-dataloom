## Installation

### Installing the plugin

1. In Obsidian, open **Settings**
2. Go to **Community plugins**
3. Select **Browse**
4. Search for **Notion-Like Tables** by **Trey Wallis**
5. Select **Install**
6. Then select **Enable**

### Linking table files

By default, Obsidian won't display `.table` files in the menu that opens when you type double brackets `[[`. In order for Obsidian to do this, you must enable detection of all file extensions.

1. In Obsidian, open **Settings**
2. Select **File & Links**
3. Toggle **Detect all file extensions**

This will allow you to make links to a table e.g. `[[mytable.table]]`

## Creating a table

Start by creating a new table. You can do this by clicking on the table icon on the sidebar.

You can also right click on a folder and click **New Notion-Like table**
