## Known Issues

### Markdown Support

Notion-Like Tables uses the Obsidian function `MarkdownRenderer.renderMarkdown` to render HTML element from markdown.
There are some known issues with this function where embedded elements, such as rendering links, is not working properly. This part of the road map for future releases.

### Undoing Changes

There is currently no support for undoing changes. This is part of the road map for future releases.
