This plugin extends the functionality of Obsidian.md. The plugin is tested during development, however I cannot guarantee that there won't be malfunctions in the software. I **strongly** recommend you to make frequent, backup copies of your vault. I am not responsible for any data that is lost due to usage of this plugin.
