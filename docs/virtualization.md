# Virtualization

## Description

The rendering of rows in the table is virtualized, meaning that they are only rendered when you scroll to them. This allows the table to render thousands of rows with minimal lag.

The plugin uses [react-virtuoso](https://github.com/petyosi/react-virtuoso) for virtualization.
