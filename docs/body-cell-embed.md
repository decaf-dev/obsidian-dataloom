# Embed cell

## Description

This cell renders an embedded link.

## Usage

Select the cell to open the embed cell edit menu. Type any url and press `Enter` or `return` or click outside of the cell to close the menu. The cell will validate the URL and render it using the [embedded file syntax](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Embedding+web+pages). If the url is invalid, the cell will display `Invalid URL`.

The embed links will work with any links that Obsidian supports. Currently Obsidian supports embedded Twitter and YouTube links
