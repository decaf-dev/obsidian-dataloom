# Source cell

## Description

This cell renders a source. For example, if the row was generated was a folder source called `test`, this cell will render `test` with a folder icon. _Internal_ means that the data was not generated from a source.

## Usage

A column with a source cell type will be added when you add your first source. If you would like to use a source but not view this column, you may toggle its [visibility](../../../features/table/toggling-column-visibility).
