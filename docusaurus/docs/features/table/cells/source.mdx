# Source cell

## Description

This cell renders the source name of a row. For example, if the row was generated from a folder source with the path name `path/test`, the cell will render `path/test` with a folder icon. If a row was generated from loom file data, **Internal** will be rendered instead.

## Usage

This cell is uneditable.

A column with a source cell type will be added when the first source is created. If you would like to hide this column, you may toggle its [visibility](../../../features/table/toggling-column-visibility).
