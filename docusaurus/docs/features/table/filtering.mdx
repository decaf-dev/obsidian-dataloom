# Filtering

Rows may be filtered by filter rules. To begin, click `Filter` in the upper right hand corner. Click the plus button to add a new filter. You can add as many filters as you want.

Filters have logical operators `and` and `or`. `and` means that all of the filter rules must be true for the row to be included. `or` means that any of the filter rules must be true for the row to be included.
