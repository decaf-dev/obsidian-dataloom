# Sorting rows

Rows can be sorted by columns in ascending (A-Z) or descending (Z-A) order. To sort by a column, click on a column header. Click `Ascending` to sort in ascending order, or `Descending` to sort in descending order. Clicking on multiple columns will apply the sort in the order the columns were clicked.

To remove a sort, click the `x` next inside of a sort bubble in the upper left hand corner.
