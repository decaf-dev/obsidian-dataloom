# Searching

Rows can be filtered by search. This is useful when you have a large table and want to find a specific row. To filter rows by search, click on the manigifying glass button in the top right corner of the table. This will open an input where you can enter a search term. The table will then be filtered to only show rows that contain the search term. A row is consider a match if the text matches any of the cells in the row.
