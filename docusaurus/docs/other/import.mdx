DataLoom allows you to import data from existing Markdown or CSV sources. You may import data from a file or from the clipboard.

1. Select the 3 dot menu in the top right corner of the loom
2. Select **Import**
3. Choose a data type: _Markdown_ or _CSV_
4. Choose a data source: _File_ or _Paste from clipboard_
5. Select the file you wish to import or paste the data from your clipboard
6. A table will be rendered from the imported data. Match each column to a column in your loom
7. Select **Finish**

## Matching columns

A column is considered matched when it is assigned to a column in the loom or when it is toggled off. You can toggle a column off by selecting the checkbox in the table header.

To match a column, select the match icon on the right side of each column header. A dropdown will appear with all of the columns in your loom. Select the column you wish to match to. If you wish to create a new column, select **New column**.

After a column has been matched, it cannot be used by other columns. If you wish to assign a column to a different column, you must first unmatch the column. To unmatch a column, select **Unmatch**.
