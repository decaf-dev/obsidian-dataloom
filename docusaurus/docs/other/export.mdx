# Export

DataLoom saves a table in a custom JSON format in a `.loom` file to your vault. Since this is a custom format, it is not easily readable by other applications. You may want to export your data to a more common format such as CSV or Markdown.

1. Select the 3 dot menu in the top right corner of the loom
2. Select **Export**
3. Choose a file type. Currently, DataLoom supports CSV and Markdown
4. Save the data

-   Select **Download** to download the file to your file system
-   Select **Copy to clipboard** to copy the file to your clipboard

## Remove markdown

The remove markdown option is disabled by default. If you want to export plain text, you may enable this option.

| Cell Type | Markdown                   | Plain Text     |
| --------- | -------------------------- | -------------- |
| Text      | [[This is my link\|Alias]] | Alias          |
| Text      | \*\*Some bold text\*\*     | Some bold text |
| Checkbox  | [ ]                        | false          |
| Checkbox  | [x]                        | true           |
