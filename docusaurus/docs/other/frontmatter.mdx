# Frontmatter

When you add an Obsidian source to your loom, you will have the option to select the property that each column corresponds to. Certain cell types can only accept properties of a certain type.

When you edit a cell in your loom the corresponding property value will be updated. Similarly, when you edit a property value in Obsidian, the corresponding cells will be updated in your loom.

Each column can only have one frontmatter key. Once a key is assigned to a column, it cannot be assigned to other columns. If you would like to use a key on a different column, you will need to remove the key and assign it to the new column.

If a column does not have a frontmatter key assigned to it, you will not be able to edit the cells in that column that belong to sources.
