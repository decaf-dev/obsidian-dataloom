# Virtualization

## Description

The rendering of rows in a loom table is virtualized, meaning that they are only rendered when you scroll to them. This allows the loom to render thousands of rows with minimal lag.

The plugin uses [react-virtuoso](https://github.com/petyosi/react-virtuoso) for virtualization.
