DataLoom is an [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) plugin for desktop and mobile. It is a database tool similar to [Notion.so](https://notion.so) and [DB folder](https://github.com/RafaelGB/obsidian-db-folder). It allows you to weave together data from diverse sources, including Obsidian elements like folders or frontmatter, and display them in multiple views. This plugin is ideal for you if you seek a straightforward yet powerful tool to create and manage databases and enhance the organization and accessibility of your Obsidian vault.
