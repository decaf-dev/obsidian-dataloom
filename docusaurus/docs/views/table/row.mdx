# Row

## Add row

To add a row, click on the **New** button in the bottom left hand corner of the table.

## Delete row
To delete a row, click the three dots button on the left side of a row. Then click the **Delete** button.

## Sort rows

Rows can be sorted by columns in ascending (A-Z) or descending (Z-A) order. To sort by a column, click on a column header. Click `Ascending` to sort in ascending order, or `Descending` to sort in descending order. Clicking on multiple columns will apply the sort in the order the columns were clicked.

To remove a sort, click the `x` next inside of a sort bubble in the upper left hand corner.


## Filter rows

### Filter rules

Rows may be filtered by filter rules. To begin, click `Filter` in the upper right hand corner. Click the plus button to add a new filter. You can add as many filters as you want.

Filters have logical operators `and` and `or`. `and` means that all of the filter rules must be true for the row to be included. `or` means that any of the filter rules must be true for the row to be included.


### Search input

Rows can be filtered by search input. This is useful when you have a large table and want to find a specific row.

To filter rows by search, click on the manigifying glass button in the top right corner of the table. This will open an input where you can enter a search term. The table will then be filtered to only show rows that contain the search term. A row is consider a match if the text matches any of the cells in the row.
