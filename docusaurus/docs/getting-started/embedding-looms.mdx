# Embedding looms

## Basic usage

> Please make sure that you have enabled [detection of loom files](../getting-started/quick-start#enable-detection-of-loom-files)

A loom may be embedded into a note by using the [embedded file syntax](https://help.obsidian.md/Linking+notes+and+files/Embedding+files).

Example loom

```markdown
![[filename.loom]]
```

An embedded loom will preform the same functions as a normal loom, the only limitation being a smaller window.

Changes that are made to an embedded loom will be saved to the loom file. Changes made to an embedded loom will also update any open tabs that contain a loom.

## Setting a width and height

An embedded loom has a default width of `100%` and a default height of `340px`. A height of `340px` will render exactly 4 body rows.

If you would like to modify the width or height of a loom, you can use the [embedded image syntax](https://help.obsidian.md/Linking+notes+and+files/Embedding+files#Embed+an+image+in+a+note).

> Note: setting a value of `0` will use the default value.

### Examples

An embedded loom with a width of `300px` and height of `300px`

```markdown
![[filename.loom|300x300]]
```

An embedded loom with a default with and height of `300px`

```markdown
![[filename.loom|0x300]]
```

An embedded loom with a width of `300px` and a default height

```markdown
![[filename.loom|300x0]]
```
