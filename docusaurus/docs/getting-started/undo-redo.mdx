# Undo and redo

| Name | Windows      | Mac                   |
| ---- | ------------ | --------------------- |
| Undo | `ctrl` + `z` | `cmd` + `z`           |
| Redo | `ctrl` + `y` | `cmd` + `shift` + `z` |

## Future development

Currently undo/redo does not exist for

-   dragging and dropping rows
-   dragging and dropping columns
