# Sources

A source is a collection of data that DataLoom can use to generate rows. Sources can be folders, tags, or APIs.

## Adding a source

To add a source, click the **Sources** button in the upper right corner of the application. This will open the **Sources** menu. Choose a source type and then enter required source information. An error will display if you do not provide sufficient information or if the source has already been added. Once finished, click **Add source**.

When you add your first source, a [Source](../../../features/table/cells/source) column and [Source file](../../../features/table/cells/source-file) column will be added to the table. The **Source** column will contain the name of the source. The **Source file** column will contain the name of the file that contains the source data.

## Deleting a source

To delete a source, click the **Sources button** and then click the edit button. Then click **Delete** for each source you would like to remove. If you delete the last source, the **Source** and **Source file** columns will be removed from the table.

## Frontmatter

Frontmatter is metadata that is stored at the top of a markdown file. Sources that originate from folders or tags will store data in the frontmatter of the file that contains the source data.

### Frontmatter key

If a column does not have a frontmatter key assigned to it, you will not be able to edit the cells in that column that belong to folder or tag source generated rows.

To select a key, click on the column header to open the column menu. Then click **Frontmatter key**. Select a key from the dropdown menu. If you would like to add a new key, click **Custom** and enter your key name.

Each column can only have one frontmatter key. Once a key is assigned to a column, it cannot be assigned to other columns. If you would like to use a key on a different column, you will need to remove the key and assign it to the new column.

When you edit a cell in your loom the corresponding frontmatter value will be updated. Similarly, when you edit a frontmatter value in Obsidian, the corresponding cells will be updated in your looms.

### Accepted properties

Obsidian adds a validation layer and user interface on top of frontmatter called [properties](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Properties).

Cell types can only accept properties of a certain type. For example, a text cell can only accept a text property.

When you choose a frontmatter key for a text cell column, only keys that are a text property will be displayed in the dropdown menu.

Use of `Date` with a date string like `12-12-2023` is not currently supported by DataLoom.
